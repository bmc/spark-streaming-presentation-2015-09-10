  <h2>Spark Streaming</h2>

   <p class="fragment">
     Spark Streaming is built on an abstraction called
     <i>discretized streams</i>, or DStreams.
   </p>

   <p class="fragment">
     A DStream is a sequence of data arriving over time.
   </p>

   <p class="fragment">
     Internally, each DStream is represented as a sequence of RDDs arriving at
     each time step. Each RDD in a DStream contains data from a certain
     interval.
