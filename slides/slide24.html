      At the end of the time interval the batch is done growing.

          The size of the time intervals is determined by a parameter called
          the <i>batch interval</i>.

          The batch interval is typically between 500 milliseconds and
          several seconds and is configured by the application developer.

      Each input batch forms an RDD.

      Each RDD is passed to Spark for
      processing in a job.

      Thus, the stream is broken into pieces (RDDs) that
      are processed individually from other pieces.
