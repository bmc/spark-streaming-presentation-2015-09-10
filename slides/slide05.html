  <h2>What is an RDD?</h2>

  <p class="fragment">
    "RDD" stands for "Resilient Distributed Dataset".
  </p>

  <p class="fragment">
    Conceptually, an RDD is a distributed collection of elements. Think of it
    as a distributed array or list...
  </p>

  <p class="fragment">
    ...like an array or list in your program, but
    spread out across multiple nodes in the cluster.
  </p>

  <p class="fragment">
    Within your program (the Driver), an <code>RDD</code> object is a
    <i>handle</i> to that distributed data.
