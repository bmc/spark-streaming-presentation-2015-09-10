  <h2>DStreams and RDDs</h2>

  <p>How is a DStream mapped to RDDs?</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">
      There are actually two time intervals: the <i>batch interval</i> and
      the <i>block interval</i>.
    </li>

    <li class="fragment">
      A new RDD is created at the end of each batch interval.
    </li>

    <li class="fragment">
      Data that comes in during the batch interval is broken into <i>blocks</i>,
      one block per block interval (which defaults to 200ms).
    </li>

    <li class="fragment">
      Thus, a batch consists of multiple blocks.
    </li>
  </ul>
