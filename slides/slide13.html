    DStream Operations
  </h2>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">
      A DStream is created from a <code>StreamingContext</code>.
    </li>

    <li class="fragment">
      Once a DStream has been created, it offers two kinds of operations:
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">
          <i>Transformations</i>, each of which yields a new DStream
        </li>
        <li class="fragment">
          <i>Output operations</i>, which write data to an external system
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li class="fragment">
      Any operation applied to a DStream translates to operations on the
      underlying RDDs that are created during stream processing.
    </li>
  </ul>
