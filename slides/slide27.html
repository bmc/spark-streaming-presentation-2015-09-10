      Spark Streaming uses a "micro-batch" architecture.
    </li>

    <li class="fragment">
      Spark Streaming continuously receives live input data streams and
      divides the data into batches.
    </li>

    <li class="fragment">
      New batches are created at regular time intervals called
      <i>batch intervals</i>.
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">
          At the beginning of each time interval a new batch is created.
        </li>
        <li class="fragment">
          Any data that arrives during that interval gets added to that batch.
        </li>
