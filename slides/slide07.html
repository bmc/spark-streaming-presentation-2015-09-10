    This RDD has 5 partitions.

    An RDD is simply a distributed collection of elements.

    In Spark all work is expressed as either creating new RDDs,
    transforming existing RDDs, or calling operations on RDDs to compute a
    result. Under the hood, Spark automatically distributes the data contained
    in RDDs across your cluster and parallelizes the operations you perform on
    them.

    So, Spark gives you APIs and functions that lets you do something on the
    whole collection in parallel, using all the nodes.
