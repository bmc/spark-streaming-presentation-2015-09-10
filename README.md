Source for Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts [PHASE][] presentation on
[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org) Streaming, 10 September, 2015.

## Preparation

1. Install [NodeJS][] and `npm`.
2. Install the [LESS][] preprocessor: `npm install -g less`
3. Make sure you have a version of Ruby 2 installed. (This stuff has been
   tested with 2.2.3.)
4. Install Bundler: `gem install bundler`
5. Use Bundler to install the required Ruby gems: `bundle install`

# Building the Slides

Once you've successfully completed preparation, building the slide deck
is as simple as:

    $ rake

Rake will build `dist/index.html`, a [Reveal.js][] slide show. Just
open the file in your browser, and away you go.

# Installing the slide show

If you want to install the slide show somewhere (e.g., a web server), copy
the _entire_ `dist` directory (presumably renaming it).

# Making PDFs

To create PDF versions of the slides, open the HTML slides in Chrome or Chromium. Then,
tack `?print-pdf` on the end of the URL, and print the result. See the Reveal.js documentation
for details.
